Testing to mimic real-life neurons and brains

Very simplistic UI and design, more of a sandbox to test different neural networks.

Design goes as follows, each creature has DNA which allows the Neural Network to be built. The basic parts of these "brains" are Neurons that have a series of Terminals. The Neurons have two values detailing its initial signal and one for its action potential. The Terminal has a value for its strength which acts as a multiplier for the signal given and increases/decreases with use/disuse.
